## Roadmap

- Adding tests to the extension :facepalm:
- Should handle quick file change and save :thinking-face:
- For now it only works with typescript / jest / `.spec.ts` convention. It should be more versatile. :flex:

## Development environment

- Clone this repo
- Open in VS Code - it will be detected as a VS Code extension source code
- Press F5 to run - it will open a new VSCode window with the extension build from source code. The opened folder is an "integration" test.
